# Next Wife - Telegram Channel Feed Viewer

## Overview
A Vite + React + TypeScript web application that displays posts from the @nextwife_ai Telegram channel. The service is an AI companion/virtual girlfriend platform where users meet girlfriends from their native locations around the world through Telegram.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (port 5000)
- **Backend**: Express.js server for Telegram scraping and image proxying (port 3001)
- **Deployment**: Replit with custom domain support
- **Development**: Both servers run concurrently via `npm run dev`

## Key Features
- Real-time Telegram channel feed display
- Image loading with retry mechanism (3 attempts with progressive timing)
- Post filtering (hides service messages)
- Automatic new post detection with refresh capability
- Special link handling for bot mentions
- Responsive design with dark theme

## Special Link Handling
Posts containing "Meet me @nextwifebot ðŸ’–" automatically link to the bot instead of the post:
- Detection: Frontend checks if post text contains "meet me @nextwifebot" (case-insensitive)
- Link override: Uses `https://t.me/nextwifebot` instead of the standard post link
- Location: `src/components/TelegramChannelFeed.tsx` lines 428-430

## Content Guidelines
- Girlfriends are from their native locations globally (not specifically Bali)
- Users "meet" their girlfriend (long-distance relationship concept)
- No Bali references in hero section or features
- Privacy-focused: Messages NOT logged, NOT used for AI training

## Recent Changes (November 1, 2025)
1. **Migrated from Supabase to Express backend** - Replaced Supabase Edge Functions with standalone Express server
2. Removed all Bali-specific references
3. Updated hero subtitle to "Meet the girlfriend you create and embark on a romantic journey, sharing unique stories from around the globe"
4. Fixed image loading during scroll with improved skeleton loader visibility
5. Updated feature descriptions to avoid repetitive phrasing
6. Added special link handling for bot mentions in posts

## Data Model
Posts from Telegram channel include:
- `id`: Post number
- `text`: Post content (HTML stripped)
- `date`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `link`: Telegram post URL
- `media`: Image URL (if present)
- `avatar`: Channel avatar URL
- `botLink`: Extracted URL from posts containing @nextwifebot mentions

## Backend API
Express server (`server.js`) provides two endpoints:

### GET /api/tg-channel-feed
- Scrapes Telegram public channel page (https://t.me/s/nextwife_ai)
- Filters out service messages (joins, leaves, etc.)
- Extracts bot links from HTML before stripping tags
- Returns JSON with channel info and posts array
- Supports pagination via `?before=` and `?limit=` parameters

### GET /api/tg-image-proxy
- Proxies Telegram CDN images to avoid CORS issues
- Validates allowed hosts (telesco.pe, telegram-cdn.org)
- Returns image with proper caching headers
- Parameter: `?u=<encoded_image_url>`

## User Preferences
- Keep all 43 unused shadcn/ui components for future use
- Privacy commitment: Messages NOT logged, NOT used for AI training
